# fun expressions

- mole goals ("moals"? quest system?)
- holy moley
- break the mole-d


# start of game

- ask for name but discard it because moles don't have names


# middle-to-late-game above-ground power fantasies

- peace treaty with humans (mole is best diplomat)

# easily solvable dilemma

mole must choose between save pups or save mole love

no

mole can both save pups and save mole love


# need to change the past

same plot as superman (1979)

change the past by chaning the written history


# fast travel by induction

mole can dig through earth

mole move forward when mole dig

## problem

can mole reach 100 spaces forward?


## solution 1

mole dig

mole dig

mole dig

...


## solution 2

```
n zero action if
  do action.

n s(X) action if
  do action
  n X action.
```

n 100 (mole dig)


# order of actions

action has order

mole can only do action if first action or if another previous action

```
Entity can X if
  actions none.

Entity can X if
  actions Y,
  any from Y Z,
  Z order before X
```

## gameplay uses if changed

- Entity can do action also before some other action (time travel)
- Entity cannot do any action (avoid responsibility)
